## ðŸ“ˆ Project Overview

This project was built to showcase real-world skills in:

- Data Analysis (Pandas, Numpy)
- Machine Learning (TF-IDF Vectorization, Cosine Similarity)
- API Integration (TMDb API)
- Frontend Web Application (Streamlit)
- Cloud Deployment (Streamlit Community Cloud)
- Version Control (Git & GitHub)

## ðŸ“š Dataset

- Source: A curated list of movies with title and overview
- File: `movies.csv`
- Fields used: `title`, `overview`

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. The user inputs a movie title.
2. If the movie exists in the dataset:
   - The app recommends 10 similar movies based on overview similarity.
3. If the movie is **NOT** in the dataset:
   - The app **fetches live overview** from **The Movie Database (TMDb) API**.
   - It dynamically vectorizes the fetched overview and recommends similar movies!
   
âœ… Real-time movie recommendation even beyond the original dataset.
